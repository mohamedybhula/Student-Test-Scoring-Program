The purpose of this project is to provide a simple user interface that allows the user to clean CSV files containing student test data, get the test results for a given student in a visual manner, compare how a student did on a specific test with their peers, find the students who underperformed relative to their peers and find the students who worked hard. For the interface to work, the two code cells in the 'menu.ipynb' file need to be ran, which will show the user a selection of buttons to choose. The user will need to click the 'Clean Files' button first, to achieve optimal functionality when using the other buttons. If the user would like the output area to be cleaned after using an option, the 'Clear All Output' button will remove the previous output. However, when the user wants to get the test results of a new student, or find out how a student performed on a specific test, their previous output will automatically be cleared when they begin entering a new student id into the respective text boxes, eliminating the need to consistently press the 'Clear All Output' button. If the user wishes to clear the text boxes and buttons that appear as a result of clicking one of the initial options, rerunning the second code cell of the Jupyter notebook will achieve this.
